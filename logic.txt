code me in html (minimum possible) css (if needed) and Javascript, in 5 pages named index.html; styles.css; index.js; game.js and components.js. The canvas will be of 400px width and 800 px heigth, with a start buton on the middle of the canvas, with arial font nd saying "Start" the middle of a 40px width and 80px heigth, when the button is clicked it desapears and small 20px ball will start from the left of the canvas to the rigth at differnt speeds every second randomly, the ball will be in a straigth line in the bottom 40 px of the canvas. After the ball hits first time rigth side it will start again from the left in a infinite loop until the "Game Over" conditions are achieved, also after it hits rigth side, a reversed U shaped object made of 5 like squares will start falling slowly from the middle top center of the canvas, this Ushaped object will be controled in its fall by left and rigth arrow keys and the down arrow key that if pressed will fall at 300px speed horizontal, if the reversed U shaped object that touches the bottom canvas with the ball between its two touching sides it stops the game and one win will be counted in a small wins counter for 50px  width by 80 right with the text : "Nr of Wins: ${0}, Lifes {3}", the 0 will change to 0+1 every time "Game Over" conditions are achieved. if the reversed U shaped object touches the ball before touching the canvas with the ball inside its two touching sides that touched the canvas, then te game stops and the "Nr of Wins: ${0}, Lifes {3}" will change to 2, when Lifes reaches 0 "Game Over" conditions are achieved and "Game Over" text will apear in the same button that had before the Start. game stops. Until this "Lifes" isn't 0 whenever conditions that resulted in "Nr of Wins: ${0} increased in +1 the ball will start again in the left side and conditions explained at the satrt of this text will be repeted (when touches rigth side, will satr again o the left, reversed U Shaped object... like explain at start. So if reversed U shaped object touches the bottom canvas with the ball inside both touching side of te object in the canvas (the same as inside of it), but without touching the ball Wins: ${0} will increase its number by one and the game starts again, any other condition that doesnt meet this one Lifes {3} will decrease by 1 and when achieves 0 "Game Over" conditions are achieved and "Game Over" text will apear in the same button that had before the Start.
